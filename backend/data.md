# About

I am an AI & ML Engineering Student and IEEE AESS Vice Chair with experience building Machine Learning and computer vision systems. My work focuses on developing scalable AI solutions, from real-time object detection assistants to traffic prediction models with high accuracy.

I have a strong foundation in Python and MLOps. When I'm not deploying models, I'm dominating in competitive gaming lobbies. I bring the same strategic depth and reaction time from the arena to my engineering challenges.

## Skills

Python, C++, C, SQL, TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, Data Science, MLOps, Docker, Flutter, Figma, VSCode
