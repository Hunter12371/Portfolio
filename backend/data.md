# About

I am an AI & ML Engineering Student and IEEE AESS Vice Chair with experience building Machine Learning and computer vision systems.
My work focuses on developing scalable AI solutions, from real-time object detection assistants to traffic prediction models with high accuracy.

I have a strong foundation in Python and MLOps. When I'm not deploying models, I'm dominating in competitive gaming lobbies.
I bring the same strategic depth and reaction time from the arena to my engineering challenges.
